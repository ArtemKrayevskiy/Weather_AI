# Voice Assistant with Weather Integration 🌤️🎙️

This project is a fully functional **Voice Assistant** built with Python and Jupyter Notebook (IPython). The assistant is capable of:

- **Accepting voice commands** 🎤
- **Retrieving weather data** from the Visual Crossing Weather API 🌦️
- **Responding with voice and text** 📢💬  

It combines speech-to-text, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech capabilities to create a seamless and interactive experience.
